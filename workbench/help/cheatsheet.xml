  <description> 
	  This Tutorial guides you through PeerThing und gives you a step by step instruction to make your own little simulation.
  </description>
</intro>
	
<item title="Step 1 : Create a folder">
	<action 
		pluginId="de.peerthing.workbench"
		class="de.peerthing.workbench.resourcetreeview.NewProjectAction"
		confirm="true"/>
	<description>
		First create a folder for the new project.
	</description>.
</item>

<item title="Step 2 : Create a System Behaviour">
	<description>
		Now create a System Behaviour File. Therefore right click on your new folder
		and select "New" -> "System behaviour". Open your System Behaviour file by double clicking on it.
	</description>.
</item>
	
<item title="Step 3 : Draw a peer behaviour">
	<description>
		Select "StartState" and rename it as "disconnect" in the property sheet below.
		Then add another state "connect". Take it from the palette into the drawing area.
		Draw a transition between these states, select it and name it "connectAccepted". 
	</description>.
</item>		
<item title="Step 4 : Add an action to your transition">
	<description>		
		Select your transition and look at the property sheet below. On the left you see 
		"Transition(connectAccepted)". Right click on this entry and add an action.
		
		Select the new action in the tree. On the right choose the action "connectionStateChanged"
		from the drop-down menu.
		
		After that a parameter is added to your action with the name "state". Set its value to "online" 
		by choosing from the drop-down list.
	</description>.
</item>	

<item title="Step 5 : Add a self transition">
	<description>	
		In the painting area draw a transition from the "disconnect" state to the "disconnect" state.
		Rename it as "connectRequest" in the property sheet. 
		Add an action to it and choose "connectionStateChange". Then select the parameter below
		this action and choose the value "online" from the drop-down menu.
		
		After that add another action to this self transition and choose the "sendMessage"-action. 
		Then add to the parameter with name "name" the value "connect".
		For the parameter with the name "destination" enter "pt:findNodeByName('server')" into the
		expression field (see help for explanations).
	</description>.
</item>			

<item title="Step 6 : Another node type ">
	<description>				
		Right click on your system behaviour file (.arch) in the resource view.
		Choose "Add Node". Select the new node type that appears in the tree view. 
		Rename it as "server" in the property sheet below the painting area. 
	</description>.
</item>				

<item title="Step 7 : Draw a server behaviour">
	<description>				
	 	Rename the start state as "idle". Then look on the left in the property sheet and 
		add an action by right clicking. 
		These actions added to a state are executed when this state is entered.
		Choose the action "connectionStateChanged".
		Select the parameter with the name "state". Set the value "online".
	</description>.
</item>	
	
<item title="Step 8 : Add a self transition">
	<description>					
		Add a self transition like you have done before. Call it "connect".
		Then add an action to this transition. Choose the action "sendMessage".
		Two parameters are added to this action. The first parameter's name is "destination".
		Enter the expression "message/@source" in the expression field.
		The second parameters name is "name". Here enter the value "connectAccepted".
		Remember that in the peer node a transition acts to this event.
		Save and close your System Behaviour file 
	</description>.
</item>	
	
<item title="Step 9 : Create a Scenario">
	<description>				
		Now create a Scenario File. Therefore right click on your folder
		and select "New" -> "Scenario". Open the Scenario tree by double clicking on the file.
	</description>.
</item>	

<item title="Step 10 : Define a Connection">
	<description>	
		Right click on "Connections" and select "add Connection". 
		Select the new connetion.
		Change the "Uplink" and "Downlink speed" of this connection to "100".
		Then change the "Uplink" and "Downlink delay" to 10. 
	</description>.
</item>					
	
<item title="Step 11 : Create a Node Category server ">
	<description>				
		Select "Node Categories" and create a new node category "server1".
		Open the tree under "Node Categories" and "server1". 
	</description>.
</item>					

<item title="Step 12 : Node Behaviour ">
	<description>		
		Open the "Node Behaviours" tree and rename the node behaviour "unknown" as "main".
	</description>.
</item>			

<item title="Step 13 : Node Connection ">
	<description>		
		Select "Node Connections" and mark the one connection we have created before in the table. 
		Open the "Node Connections" tree and select the entry "newConnection_1" below. 
		Set "number of server1 with this connection" to "1".
	</description>.
</item>			

<item title="Step 14 : Node Category for 'server' ">
	<description>		
		 Select your node category "server1". Enter as "System Behaviour Node" "server".
		 The "primary behaviour" should be "main". 
	</description>.
</item>	

<!-- scenario : peer -->
						
<item title="Step 15 : Create a Node Category for 'peer' ">
	<description>				
		Select "Node Categories" and create a new node category "peer1".
		Open the tree under "Node Categories" and "peer1". 		
	</description>.
</item>			

<item title="Step 16 : Node Behaviour ">
	<description>		
		Open the "Node Behaviours" tree and rename the node behaviour "unknown" as "main".
		Then click "Create Action". Open the tree under "main" and select the new action.
		Rename it as "connectRequest". Change the probability to "80".
	</description>.
</item>					
	
<item title="Step 17 : Node Connection ">
	<description>		
		Select "Node Connections" and mark the one connection we have created in step 10 in the table. 
		Open the "Node Connections" tree and select the entry "newConnection_1" below. 
		Set "number of peer1 with this connection" to "5".
	</description>.
</item>			

<item title="Step 18 : Node Category peer ">
	<description>		
		 Select your node category "peer1". Enter as "System Behaviour Node" "peer".
		 The "primary behaviour" should be "main". 
		 Save and close the Scenario file.
	</description>.
</item>	

<item title="Step 19 : Start a Simulation ">
	<description>		
		 Press Ctrl and select your System Behaviour and Scenario file. 
		 From the context menu choose "Open with Simulator". 
		 Enter a name (e.g. "log1') for the log file in the simulator form. 
		 Push the link "Run next time steps". 
		 Select the generated table entries to get detailed informations. 
		
		 You can reset the simulation and make another run. Enter a new name
		 for the log file to store this simulation.
	</description>.
</item>		

<item title="Step 20 : Create a Query Defintion ">
	<description>	
		Select your folder and choose "New" - "Query definition" from context menu. 
		Right click on your query definition and select "New Query". 
		Right click on this query and select "Add visualization information". 		
		
		Then click on visualization line chart.
		Enter this SQL-Statement into the form:
	"select TimeSent, MessageId from Message where SimulationRun=$RUN$ 
	and TimeSent between $STARTTIME$ and $ENDTIME$"
	</description>.
</item>	
		
<item title="Step 21 : View the results">
	<description>
		Double click on your log file in the resource view. Then double click on your 
		query definition. 		
	</description>.
